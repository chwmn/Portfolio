      writing tables to end grain cutting boards.

    <!--<p>
      Pulling from design aesthetics and iconography found in my home, culture,
      and family, I aim to create heirloom quality furniture in the hopes of one
      day passing on more than just a legacy to future generations. With a
      certain humility and intimacy, these pieces of furniture highlight the
      importance of family and bicultural identity while also being an integral
      part of daily life.
