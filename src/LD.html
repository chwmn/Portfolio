      I enjoy drawing from life a lot because it is able to capture an intimate
      and personal perspective that cameras can't. Although admittedly more
      limited in scope, through pencil and paper, the audience is able to see
      the subject through the lens of the artist, and I think that's pretty
      cool.

      Drawing from life may seem to lose meaning when our phones and cameras at
      our finger tips. Why spend hours to depict someone's exact likeness when
      it can be done within moments? However, drawing from life allows viewers
      to see the artist's perspective in a unique way that photo technology
      cannot, and I think thats pretty cool.
