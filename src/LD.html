      Drawing from life may seem to lose meaning with our phones and cameras at
      our finger tips. Why spend hours to depict someone's exact likeness when
      it can be done within moments? However, drawing from life allows viewers
      to see the artist's perspective in a unique way that photo technology
      lacks, and I think thats pretty cool.
