          From the beginning of this project, I had the idea for the landing
          page that a log would split into sections like how logs are
          milled—e.g. flat sawn or quarter sawn—to then display the site pages.
          It gave me a lot of headaches, however in the end I was able to bring
          my idea to fruition using CSS animations and SVG images. I had so much
          fun creating images with CSS, that the site's graphics were made
          almost entirely using just CSS.
