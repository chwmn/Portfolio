    <h2>Problems</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        Through 5 interviews with students using Canvas (in fall of 2020), I
        boiled down the main problems with the current system to 3 main items:
      </p>

      <div class="smallSpace"></div>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Disorganized and varying organization structures between classes.
        </li>

        <li>
          Too many options to click through in order to reach destination.
        </li>

        <li>
          Too much time spent on adjusting and figuring out each class site
          structure.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="processInfo">
    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        As a result, I decided to focus on 3 main ideas in order to create a
        learning management system that can aid students' work-flow while also
        allowing instructors to setup their classes intuitively and with similar
        organization structures:
      </p>

      <div class="smallSpace"></div>

      <ol>
        <li>Pare down the current hierarchy to the bare essentials.</li>

        <li>
          Consistent organization between classes for both students and
          instructors.
        </li>

        <li>
          Intuitive and efficient use in order to maintain workflow without
          interruption.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="processInfo">
    <h2>Site Map 1</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        After running card sorting with the same interviewees, the first
        hierarchical solution that I came up with split the content into three
        main categories:
      </p>

      <div class="smallSpace"></div>

      <ol>
        <li>Agenda</li>

        <li>Class Information</li>

        <li>Profile</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="space"></div>

      <p>
        The 'agenda' category presents relevant class information in a
        meaningful way in order to aid students' workflow. The 'class
        information' category is for class-specific course work as well as
        grades, while the 'profile' category serves as an overall settings,
        preferences, and class history.
      </p>

        <p>First site map made in optimal workshop.</p>

  <div class="processInfo">
    <h2>Site Map 2</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        After tree testing 5 scenarios involving the same interviewees, I
        decided to further reduce the 'class information' options because there
        seemed to be confusion as to where certain items were located. Only 6
        categories remained within 'class information':
      </p>

      <div class="smallSpace"></div>
      <ol>
        <li>Class Home</li>

        <li>Assignments</li>

        <li>Modules</li>

        <li>Class Calendar</li>

        <li>Syllabus</li>

        <li>Grade</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="space"></div>

        <p>Second site map made in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

        <p>Web wireframe made in Figma.</p>

    <h2>Final Result</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        The final site was created using HTML and SASS with 11ty. Essentially
        functioning as a high fidelity prototype, the site demonstrates how the
        more straightforward organization scheme can aid in maintaining workflow
        while also being clear and concise in the information it provides.
