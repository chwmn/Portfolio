          This visual library is an assortment of inspirations taken mainly from
          instagram and organized in my own way. It was created within 11ty
          using HTML and SASS as well as Shopify's Liquid. The site utilizes
          JSON data in order to organize relevant information such as artists'
          names, instagram handles, and my own custom categories. Using Liquid,
          the site is able to sort and display relevant cards based on assigned
          categories. Javascript is also used to create a display function in
          order to gt a better look at individual cards and their information.

          The main issue that prevents me from using this library more in my
          daily practice is the lengthy load times. I have looked into a few
          solutions that I would like to implement in the future such as lazy
          loading, or even multiple pages in order to split up load times.
          Regardless, I have used this as a resource on multiple occasions and
          am very happy with the outcome.
