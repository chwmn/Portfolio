    <p>
      This visual library is an assortment of inspirations taken mainly from
      instagram and organized in my own way. It was created within 11ty using
      HTML and SASS as well as Shopify's Liquid. The site utilizes JSON data in
      order to organize relevant information such as artists' names, instagram
      handles, and my own custom categories. Using Liquid, the site is able to
      sort and display relevant cards based on assigned categories. Javascript
      is also used to create a display function in order to gt a better look at
      individual cards and their information.
