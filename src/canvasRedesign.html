      <h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
      <p>
        Started as a part of my UI/UX class at MICA, the goal of this project
        was to redesign Instructure's Canvas in order to create a learning
        management system focused on overall clarity and organization, as well
        as intuitive use for both students and instructors.
