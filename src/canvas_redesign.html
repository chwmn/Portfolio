      <div class="projectDescript">
        <p class="info hidden">
          Through 5 interviews with students using Canvas (in fall of 2020), I
          boiled down the main problems with the current system to 3 main items:
        </p>

        <ol class="info hidden">
          <li>
            Disorganized and varying organization structures between classes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Too many options to click through in order to get to destination.
          </li>
          <li>
            Too much time spent on adjusting and figuring out each class
            structure.
          </li>
        </ol>

      </div>
      <div class="projectDescript">
        <p class="info hidden">
          As a result, I decided to focus on 3 main ideas in order to create a
          learning management system that can aid students' work-flow while also
          allowing instructors to setup their classes intuitively and with
          similar organization structures:
        </p>
        <ol class="info hidden">
          <li>
            Simplicity in options â†’ pare down current heirarchy to only the bare
            essentials.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consistent organization between classes for both students and
            instructors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Intuitive and efficient use in order to maintain workflow without
            interruption.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <div class="projectDescript">
        <div class="info hidden">
          <p>
            After running card sorting with the same interviewees, the first
            hierarchical solution that I came up with split the content into
            three main categories:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>Agenda</li>
            <li>Class Information</li>
            <li>Profile</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="info hidden">
          The 'agenda' category presents relevant class information in a
          meaningful way in order to aid students' workflow. The 'class
          information' category is for class-specific course work as well as
          grades, while the 'profile' category serves as an overall settings,
          preferences, and class history.

        <h2>SITE MAP 2</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="projectDescript">
        <p class="info hidden">
          After tree testing 5 scenarios involving the same interviewees, I
          decided to further reduce the 'class information' options because
          there seemed to be confusion as to where certain items were located.
          Only 6 categories remained within 'class information':
        </p>
        <ol class="info hidden">
          <li>Class Home</li>
          <li>Assignments</li>
          <li>Modules</li>
          <li>Class Calendar</li>
          <li>Syllabus</li>
          <li>Grade</li>
